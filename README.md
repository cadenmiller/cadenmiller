## Projects

### IEP (Iterative Engine Project)
I work on games and how they can function. This is where my code goes.

### Parking66
My school asked us to paint the parking spots, so I painted a functional 1.6m(5'3" ft) QR code. It points to [this repository](https://github.com/cullvox/Parking66). I got parking spot 66.
